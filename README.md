# Portfolio Website

I'm using sveltekit as it offers a very pleasant and simple development process, allowing me to quickly develop a portfolio with very minimal syntaxes compared to doing it in vanilla html javascript (it'll be much harder to manipulate the DOM and I would've used alpine.js or jQuery to make my development process easier).

## Progress Documentation

- Imgur seems to restrict images that are being requsted from the dev server http://127.0.0.1:5173. To mitigate, simply change the front portion to http://localhost:5173
- Projects are stored in src/lib/utils/projects.ts

# Portfolio Website

It is still in progress. I'm using sveltekit as it offers a very pleasant and simple development process, allowing me to quickly develop a portfolio without having to do it in vanilla html javascript (it'll be much harder to manipulate the DOM and I would've used alpine.js or jQuery to make my development process easier).

It also offers SEO optimization! Hence, my portfolio should be able to get indexed by search engines easier than using plain web single-app web frameworks.

## Progress Documentation

- Imgur seems to restrict images that are being requsted from the dev server http://127.0.0.1:5173. To mitigate, simply change the front portion to http://localhost:5173
